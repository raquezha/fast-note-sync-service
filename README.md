- [ ] Optimize the existing offline note merging scheme and introduce conflict resolution mechanisms.

We are continuously improving, and here is our future development roadmap:

> **If you have suggestions for improvement or new ideas, feel free to share them with us by submitting an issue — we will carefully evaluate and adopt suitable ones.**

## 🚀 Quick Deployment

We provide multiple installation methods. We highly recommend using the **One-click Script** or **Docker**.

### Method 1: One-click Script (Recommended)

Automatically detects the system environment and completes the installation and service registration.

```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/haierkeys/fast-note-sync-service/master/scripts/quest_install.sh)
```

For users in China, you can use the Tencent `cnb.cool` mirror source:
```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://cnb.cool/haierkeys/fast-note-sync-service/-/git/raw/master/scripts/quest_install.sh) --cnb
```


**Main Script Behaviors:**

  * Automatically downloads the Release binary adapted to the current system.
  * Installs to `/opt/fast-note` by default and creates a global shortcut command `fns` in `/usr/local/bin/fns`.
  * Configures and starts Systemd (Linux) or Launchd (macOS) services to enable startup on boot.
  * **Management commands**: `fns [install|uninstall|start|stop|status|update|menu]`
  * **Interactive menu**: Run `fns` directly to enter the interactive menu, supporting install/upgrade, service control, startup configuration, and switching between GitHub and CNB mirrors.

### Method 2: Docker Deployment

#### Docker Run

```bash
# 1. Pull Image
docker pull haierkeys/fast-note-sync-service:3.3.3

# 2. Start Container
docker run -tid --name fast-note-sync-service \
    -p 9000:9000 \

    container_name: fast-note-sync-service
    restart: always
    ports:
      - "9000:9000"  # RESTful API & WebSocket port (where /api/user/sync is the WebSocket interface address)
    volumes:
      - ./storage:/fast-note-sync/storage  # Data storage
      - ./config:/fast-note-sync/config    # Configuration files
```

Start the service:

./fast-note-sync-service run -c config/config.yaml
```

## 📖 User Guide

1.  **Access Admin Panel**:
    Open `http://{Server_IP}:9000` in your browser.
2.  **Initial Setup**:
    Register an account on your first visit. *(To disable registration, set `user.register-is-enable: false` in the configuration file)*
3.  **Configure Client**:
    Log in to the admin panel and click **"Copy API Config"**.
4.  **Connect to Obsidian**:
    Open the Obsidian plugin settings page and paste the configuration information you just copied.


## ⚙️ Configuration Description

The default configuration file is `config.yaml`. The application automatically searches in the **root directory** or the **config/** directory.

View the complete configuration example: [config/config.yaml](https://github.com/haierkeys/fast-note-sync-service/blob/master/config/config.yaml)

## 🧰 MCP (Model Context Protocol) Support

FNS now natively supports **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** and provides both **SSE** and **StreamableHTTP** transport protocols.

You can integrate FNS as an MCP server directly into compatible AI clients like Cherry Studio, Cursor, Claude Code, and hermes-agent. Once integrated, the AI will gain the ability to read and write your personal notes and attachments. In addition, all modifications made via MCP will be synchronized to your client devices in real-time via WebSocket.

For OAuth-protected MCP deployments with Stytch, see [docs/runbook/mcp-oauth-stytch.md](docs/runbook/mcp-oauth-stytch.md) ([简体中文](docs/runbook/mcp-oauth-stytch.zh-CN.md), [繁體中文](docs/runbook/mcp-oauth-stytch.zh-TW.md)).

### Common Request Header Parameters

The following request headers are supported regardless of the transport mode used:

- **Authorization Header**: `Authorization: Bearer <Your API Token>` (obtained from the Copy API Config option in the WebGUI)
- **Optional Header**: `X-Default-Vault-Name: <Vault Name>` (specifies the default Vault name for MCP operations if no `vault` parameter is provided during a tool call)
- **Optional Header**: `X-Client: <Client Type>` (the type of client connecting to MCP, e.g., `Cherry Studio`, `OpenClaw`)
- **Optional Header**: `X-Client-Version: <Client Version>` (the version of the client connecting, e.g., `1.1`)
- **Optional Header**: `X-Client-Name: <Client Name>` (the name of the client connecting, e.g., `Mac`)

---

### Integration Config: StreamableHTTP Mode (Recommended)

StreamableHTTP is the standard transport protocol in the MCP ecosystem. A single endpoint can handle all requests, making it more firewall-friendly. It is natively supported by newer MCP clients (such as Claude Code and hermes-agent).

- **Interface Address**: `http://<Your_Server_IP_or_Domain>:<Port>/api/mcp`
- **Request Method**: `POST` (send requests/notifications), `GET` (listen for server-side push notifications), `DELETE` (terminate sessions)

#### Example: Claude Code / hermes-agent / Cursor, etc.

*(Note: Please replace `<ServerIP>`, `<Port>`, `<Token>`, and `<VaultName>` with your actual information)*

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "fns": {
      "url": "http://<ServerIP>:<Port>/api/mcp",
      "type": "http",
      "headers": {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        "Authorization": "Bearer <Token>",
        "X-Default-Vault-Name": "<VaultName>",
        "X-Client": "<Client>",
        "X-Client-Version": "<ClientVersion>",
        "X-Client-Name": "<ClientName>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

---

### Integration Config: SSE Mode (Backward Compatible)

SSE mode is the legacy transport protocol. It is fully retained to maintain backward compatibility, suitable for MCP clients that only support SSE (such as Cherry Studio).

- **Interface Address**: `http://<Your_Server_IP_or_Domain>:<Port>/api/mcp/sse`

#### Example: Cherry Studio / Cline, etc.

*(Note: Please replace `<ServerIP>`, `<Port>`, `<Token>`, and `<VaultName>` with your actual information)*

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "fns": {
      "url": "http://<ServerIP>:<Port>/api/mcp/sse",
      "type": "sse",
      "headers": {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        "Authorization": "Bearer <Token>",
        "X-Default-Vault-Name": "<VaultName>",
        "X-Client": "<Client>",
        "X-Client-Version": "<ClientVersion>",
        "X-Client-Name": "<ClientName>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
